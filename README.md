I faced a very simple and small problem, which is that when I wanted to calculate how many days were left until my next appointment,
starting from the day I have, it may seem simple, but I wanted to be creative in it by writing a programming code using the JavaScript wrapper
and some formatting using CSS so that I can calculate this equation only by entering the day I have and the day of the appointment.
